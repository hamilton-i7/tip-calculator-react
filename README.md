## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass and CSS modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I didn't previously know the property for changing the cursor's color within an input element.

```scss
$primary-color: #26c0ab;

input {
  caret-color: $primary-color-1;
}
```

### Continued development

Something I'm planning to keep on working is creating more reusable components.
